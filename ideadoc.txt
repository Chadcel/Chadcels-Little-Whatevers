So, space invaders, right?

The concept is pretty simple, a little thing moving across the bottom of the screen, shoots pellets at enemies above it
The real question is the implementation, and tbh, I have no idea what I'm doing.

It'd be fun to go super overboard with it, say a GameObject class, which both the player and enemy classes inherit from,
and there can be multiple types of enemies, too. They can all have their own classes too.

Something along the lines of:
	GameObject
	    |  \
	   / \ Bullet
      Player Enemy
      	        |
	      /  \
   BulletShooter |
	    RocketShooter

Very rough concept. Idk about any of the specifics yet. Also, what seperates Player from Enemy?

I guess I can try my hand at spritework with this one too. Shouldn't be too hard.
